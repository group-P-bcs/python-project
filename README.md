This Flask application provides a simple voting system with user authentication and authorization. Let's break down the key components and functionality:

1. Imports and Setup: The application imports necessary modules from Flask and Flask-SocketIO for handling web requests and real-time communication, as well as Werkzeug for password hashing. It initializes the Flask application and SocketIO instance.

2. Dummy Database: There are two dummy databases represented as lists of dictionaries: `users` for storing user information including username, hashed password, and role, and `candidates` for storing candidate information including ID, name, and votes.

3. Authentication and Authorization Functions:
   - `authenticate(username, password)`: Checks if the provided username and password match any user in the database.
   - `authorize(role)`: A decorator function that restricts access to certain routes based on user role.

4. Routes:
   - `/`: Renders the index page.
   - `/login`: Handles user login, authenticates the user, and redirects to the dashboard upon successful login.
   - `/register`: Allows users to register by providing a username and password. It hashes the password before storing it in the database.
   - `/dashboard`: Renders the user dashboard, showing the list of candidates and allowing the user to vote.
   - `/admin/dashboard`: Renders the admin dashboard, which is similar to the user dashboard but intended for admin users.
   - `/vote`: Handles the user's vote submission. It updates the candidate's vote count and marks the user as voted.
   - `/logout`: Logs the user out by removing the username from the session.

5. SocketIO Integration: Real-time vote updates are broadcasted to all connected clients using SocketIO. This occurs whenever a vote is cast.

6. Running the Application: The application runs using SocketIO with debug mode enabled.

This application provides basic functionality for user authentication, registration, voting, and role-based authorization. It serves as a good starting point for building more complex voting systems.
